# Introduction
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an essential part of building conversational interfaces. There are several NLP tools available that can help developers build chatbots and other conversational interfaces. This repository compares the utility of four popular NLP tools: RASA, LUIS, WATSON, and DIALOGFLOW.

The comparison is based on several factors, including ease of use, performance, scalability, customization, and pricing. The goal of this comparison is to provide developers with a comprehensive overview of the strengths and weaknesses of each tool, so they can choose the right tool for their project.

## Installation
The code in this repository is written in Python and requires several libraries to be installed. You can install the required libraries by running the following command:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
To compare the different NLP tools, we have created several test cases that cover different aspects of NLP, such as intent classification, entity extraction, sentiment analysis, and chatbot functionality. Each test case is implemented using each of the four NLP tools, and the results are compared.

To run the tests, navigate to the tests directory and run the following command:
```python
python run_tests.py
```
The results of the tests will be printed to the console and also saved to a CSV file.

## Supported Platforms
The NLP tools compared in this repository are supported on several platforms, including web, mobile, and desktop. Each tool has its own set of SDKs and APIs that can be used to integrate it with your application.
